    <description>What does this tool do? 
 
The PD Library is a tool that stores position descriptions across the enterprise.  The tool allows those in HR position classification to create and maintain position descriptions, and allows read-only users, primarily managers and HR Specialists, to search for and view PDs.
 Purpose: 
 This tool was developed to reduce the time spent on position classification.  The tool allows Managers and Human Resources Specialists to view position descriptions and collaborate, which in turn increases consistency and efficiency.   
 Who will use this database? 
 Human Resource Specialists, Managers, and other specifically approved people.
 For information on using the tool, please consult your servicing HR office.
