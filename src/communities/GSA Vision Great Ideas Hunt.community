    <description>The Hunt will close on Friday, October 16th. Afterward, all ideas will be forward to the POC for each initiative. Also, we will be sending out 30 and 90-day updates for the top vote-getting idea on each initiative. We want you to know how your ideas are making a difference. Thank you for taking the time to help make GSA stronger. See insite.gsa.gov/vision for more information.</description>
