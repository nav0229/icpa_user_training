    <description>Make sure your idea shines! It will be important that the ideas submitted be detailed and include a description of what you think will be needed to make them happen. Think about things like cost, time, involvement of other agencies, etc. The more detailed your idea&apos;s description is, the better the review team will be able to see its value. The search for ideas will last until August 6th. After that, the ideas will be handed over to a team (designated by the Deputy Administrator) to evaluate and make recommendations to senior leadership as they begin the process of identifying new initiatives within their offices. Special consideration will be given to ideas that receive the most votes before closing time.</description>
